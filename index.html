        <header><h1>Rules</h1></header>
         <p>Volleyball, like any sport, has a set of rules that govern how the game is played. These rules ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the sport. Here are some of the key rules you need to know:</p>
  <p>1. **Scoring**: In volleyball, teams earn points by successfully grounding the ball on the opponent's side of the court or when the opposing team commits a fault. A team must win a rally to earn a point, and matches are typically played to a certain number of points, such as 25 or 21, with a two-point margin to win the set.</p>
  <p>2. **Rotation**: Players must rotate positions on the court in a clockwise manner when their team wins the serve from the opposing team. This ensures that all players have an equal opportunity to play different positions throughout the game.</p>
  <p>3. **Faults**: Various actions can result in a fault, such as serving the ball into the net, stepping on or over the centerline, making illegal contacts with the ball (e.g., double hit, lift), or touching the net during play. When a fault occurs, the opposing team is awarded a point and the serve.</p>

         <p>Playing volleyball requires specific equipment to ensure the safety and enjoyment of players. Here's a look at some essential equipment used in volleyball:</p>
  <p>1. Volleyball: The most important piece of equipment is, of course, the volleyball itself. It is usually made of synthetic leather and comes in various sizes and weights for different levels of play.</p>
  <p>2. Net and Posts: A volleyball net spans the width of the court, dividing it into two equal halves. It is supported by posts on either side of the court and must be set at a specific height for regulation play.</p>
  <p>3. Court Boundary Lines: Boundary lines mark the perimeter of the volleyball court and define the playing area. These lines are typically made of tape or painted on the floor and include the sidelines, endlines, and centerline.</p>
